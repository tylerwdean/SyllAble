These will help your understanding of what is covered during class.  For those Pre-Class Prep assignments you need to produce something for, please submit your work to the associated assignment on Canvas before the start of class.  While these assignments are not technically graded, they are formative and helpful… and they tend to be pretty quick.\n\nThese are not formally graded because they are irregularly assigned.  I don’t want you to lose points because one “pops up” when you least expect it."
